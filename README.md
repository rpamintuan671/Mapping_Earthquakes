# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to find out if the earthquakes that are over 4.5 magnitude have any correclation to the tectonic plates' location on earth. The data would be displayed on the third map.


## Resources

> * Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, Leaflet 1.7.1, D3.js 6.2.
> * Data Source: [Earthquakes GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson), [Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson), [Tectonic Plate GeoJSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)


## Results
The majority of the earthquakes with  magnitue of over 4.5 had occured closed to the tectonic plates worldwide. An interactive map webpage was created with datas from resources pulled from USGS.gov website.


## Link to Interactive Maps webpage
Follow the link to deploy the [interactive maps webpage](https://rpamintuan671.github.io/Earthquakes/)

A legend is provided in the top right corner of the map. Users have an option to choose 3 different types of maps from street, satellite and Dark view. Users would also be able to click on the earthquakes alone or show tectonic plates or major earthquakes.
